This sign is visible on the way up the stairs and into Trunchbull's office in the 2022 Netflix Film at around 24m30s.

Typeface on the screen prop seems to be DIN Alternate Bold -- https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/DIN-Alternate-Bold -- All letterforms have been converted to outlines in the saved file.

I've regenerated it in Inkscape as two files -- one that looks right visually with the white stroke around the outside, and one that should work on a k40 laser (red line = vector cut) to cut a red overlay for a white sign to mimic the prop.
